# blankmaps
These are blank maps of metabolic pathways for omics analysis.
*GML formats
*Available on VANTED
*Available on Shimadzu Multi-omics Analysis Gadget Pack
These maps were created by the members in Anayltical Biotechnology Lab. in Osaka University. Japan.
We also thank to all collaborators.
